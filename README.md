Video Demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZpvuFdKi7SRNoAS3xMlRjCsLKf3YAOHP/view?usp=sharing

Description:

The Employee Attendance System allows employees to mark their attendance with clock-in and clock-out time stamps and also apply for leaves specifying the start and end dates, reason, and check the status of their leave applications, which may be pending, approved, or declined. The system provides HR with the ability to generate attendance reports for the last 15 days or the current month, displaying clock-in and clock-out times for each employee within the selected period. HR can also manage leave requests by approving or denying them; approved leaves automatically mark the corresponding dates as "On Leave" in the attendance records. Data on the employees, attendance logs, and leave requests are persisted in a JSON file named employees.json. The system includes password authentication for the HR person (hr123). Automatic screen clearing and pauses between lines have been included for easy readability.
